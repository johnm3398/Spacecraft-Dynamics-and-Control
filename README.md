This repository is a comprehensive collection of tools, codes, and resources developed to study and analyze the dynamics and control of spacecraft. It is structured to support learning, testing, and research in the field of spacecraft attitude and motion kinematics, as well as their applications in control systems.


## 🚀 Motivation

The study of spacecraft dynamics and control is crucial for advancing space exploration and satellite technology. This repository was created to:

- Facilitate a deeper understanding of rigid body kinematics and dynamics.
- Provide a modular library (**AttitudeKinematicsLib**) of reusable functions and utilities for attitude representation and transformations (e.g., DCMs, Euler Angles, Principal Rotation Vectors, CRPs, MRPs).
- Serve as a testing ground for validating mathematical formulations and numerical implementations of attitude kinematics and dynamics.
- Support coursework, simulations, and projects related to spacecraft control systems.


## 📚 Attribution

This repository is inspired in part by the structure and rigor of **Hanspeter Schaub's** textbook:

> *"[Analytical Mechanics of Space Systems, Fourth Edition](https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/book/10.2514/4.105210)"* — by Hanspeter Schaub and John L. Junkins (AIAA Education Series)

While this project is **not a reproduction** of the book, many of the concepts, coordinate systems, and formulation styles reflect the pedagogical clarity and structure found in that reference.
