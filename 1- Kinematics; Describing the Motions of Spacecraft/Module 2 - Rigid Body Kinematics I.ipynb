    "## <ins>Properties of the Direction Cosine Matrix (DCM)</ins>\n",
    "\n",
    "The Direction Cosine Matrix (DCM), denoted as $[C]$, has some unique properties due to its definition and the orthogonality of the coordinate frames it relates. One of the key properties is that the inverse of a DCM is simply its transpose. This property can be explained as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1 - Orthogonality\n",
    "\n",
    "- A DCM is an orthogonal matrix, which means its columns (and rows) are orthogonal unit vectors. Mathematically, this is represented by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "[C]^T [C] = [I]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Here, $[I]$ is the identity matrix. The columns of $[C]$ represent the basis vectors of one coordinate frame expressed in another. Since these basis vectors are orthogonal and normalized, their dot product (which is what matrix multiplication represents) is 1 if the vectors are the same (diagonal of the identity matrix) and 0 if they are different (off-diagonal elements of the identity matrix).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2 - Inverse and Transpose\n",
    "\n",
    "- For any orthogonal matrix, the transpose is equal to its inverse. This is because the dot product of each pair of different columns (or rows) is zero, and the dot product of each column (or row) with itself is one. Therefore:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "[C]^{-1} = [C]^T\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- This property is particularly useful because it simplifies many computations. Instead of performing a potentially complex matrix inversion, one can simply transpose the matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "- When we multiply a DCM by its transpose, we get the identity matrix:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "[C] [C]^T = [C]^T [C] = [I]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- This equation confirms that the transpose of the DCM serves as its inverse. The identity matrix, which is the result of this multiplication, has ones on its diagonal and zeros elsewhere, which aligns with the definition of the identity matrix in linear algebra.\n",
    "\n",
    "These properties of the DCM are fundamental in rigid body kinematics and are widely used in applications such as spacecraft attitude control, where efficient and reliable computational methods are essential. **Note that in the context of rigid body  kinematics, DCM is always 3x3.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3 - Determinant of a DCM\n",
    "\n",
    "- The determinant of a Direction Cosine Matrix (DCM) has an important geometric interpretation in the context of coordinate transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For a proper rotation matrix, which describes a rotation without any reflection, the determinant is equal to +1:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\det([C]) = +1\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- This property signifies that the orientation transformation preserved by the DCM does not include a reflection. A determinant of +1 ensures that the coordinate transformation maintains a right-handed coordinate system after the rotation. In other words, the volume and the 'handedness' of the space remain unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A DCM with a determinant of -1 would represent an improper rotation, which includes a reflection across a plane, leading to a change in the orientation of the coordinate system from right-handed to left-handed or vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Therefore, in the study of rigid body kinematics, especially in aerospace applications where maintaining the correct 'handedness' of the coordinate system is crucial, DCMs are required to have a determinant of +1 to be considered valid for describing the spacecraft's attitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4 - Composition of DCMs\n",
    "\n",
    "- The composition property of Direction Cosine Matrices (DCMs) allows us to relate three different coordinate frames. For example, if we have a navigation frame (N-frame), a body frame (B-frame), and a reference frame (R-frame), we can define the transformation from the N-frame to the B-frame with a DCM denoted as $[BN]$, and from the B-frame to the R-frame with a DCM denoted as $[RB]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The DCM that represents the transformation from the N-frame directly to the R-frame, denoted as $[RN]$, can be found by multiplying the two DCMs:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "[RN] = [RB] \\cdot [BN]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- In this expression, $[BN]$ transforms a vector defined in the N-frame to the B-frame, and $[RB]$ further transforms that vector from the B-frame to the R-frame. The result, $[RN]$, is the DCM that maps vectors directly from the N-frame to the R-frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "- This property is based on the fact that rotations are associative; thus, the order of the multiplication of matrices matters, but they can be grouped in any order.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It's important to note that while the DCMs themselves are added or multiplied, the vectors they transform are multiplied by the DCMs to achieve the new coordinates in the different frames. The term 'addition' in this context does not refer to the arithmetic addition of matrices but to the combination of transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- This DCM composition is used extensively in aerospace engineering to describe the orientation of a spacecraft in an inertial reference frame by sequentially applying transformations from the spacecraft's body frame to an intermediate frame and then to the inertial frame."

    "Euler angles are a method for describing the orientation of a rigid body in three-dimensional space. They provide a way to express the angular position of a body through three sequential rotations around specified axes, named after the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler, who introduced them. Euler angles are widely used in various fields such as robotics, aerospace, computer graphics, and physics for tasks that involve rotation and orientation of objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <ins>Definition and Conventions\n",
    "\n",
    "Euler angles consist of three angles, typically denoted as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Roll (ϕ or φ):** Rotation about the body's X-axis.\n",
    "- **Pitch (θ or θ):** Rotation about the body's Y-axis.\n",
    "- **Yaw (ψ or ψ):** Rotation about the body's Z-axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sequence in which these rotations are applied is crucial, as it defines the final orientation of the body. Common sequences include ZYX (yaw-pitch-roll) and XYZ (roll-pitch-yaw), among others.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine holding a book in front of you, with the cover facing you and the spine aligned with your body's vertical axis. This setup can help visualize:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Roll (ϕ):** Rotating the book about its spine. Similar to tilting your head to the side.\n",
    "- **Pitch (θ):** Tilting the book up or down, akin to nodding your head.\n",
    "- **Yaw (ψ):** Turning the book left or right, similar to shaking your head.\n",
    "\n",
    "These angles represent the sequential rotations needed to achieve any desired orientation of the book (or any rigid body) relative to your initial viewpoint."
