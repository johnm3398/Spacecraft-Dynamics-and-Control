    "# Week 1 - Continuous Systems and Rigid Bodies\n",
    "\n",
    "Week 1 introduces the fundamental principles behind the dynamics of continuous systems and their simplification into rigid bodies. The development of the equations of motion is rooted in classical Eulerian and Newtonian mechanics, focusing on angular momentum and rotational kinetic energy. The approach ensures the equations are derived in a coordinate frame-agnostic manner, making them broadly applicable across various reference frames.\n",
    "\n",
    "The week begins with an exploration of continuous systems, where deformable shapes are analyzed to capture the full complexity of their motion. These systems are then simplified into rigid bodies, a common approximation in spacecraft dynamics. This transition enables the formulation of simplified, yet powerful, equations of motion for systems with spinning components, such as reaction wheels or flywheels.\n",
