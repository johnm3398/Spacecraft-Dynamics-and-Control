    "# Week 1 - Continuous Systems and Rigid Bodies\n",
    "\n",
    "Week 1 introduces the fundamental principles behind the dynamics of continuous systems and their simplification into rigid bodies. The development of the equations of motion is rooted in classical Eulerian and Newtonian mechanics, focusing on angular momentum and rotational kinetic energy. The approach ensures the equations are derived in a coordinate frame-agnostic manner, making them broadly applicable across various reference frames.\n",
    "\n",
    "The week begins with an exploration of continuous systems, where deformable shapes are analyzed to capture the full complexity of their motion. These systems are then simplified into rigid bodies, a common approximation in spacecraft dynamics. This transition enables the formulation of simplified, yet powerful, equations of motion for systems with spinning components, such as reaction wheels or flywheels.\n",

    "**Key Insight**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The rigid body assumption ensures that $\\boldsymbol{\\omega}$, the angular velocity, is constant across the body, allowing it to be taken out of the integral.\n",
    "- The inertia tensor $\\mathbf{I}_c$ directly relates angular momentum $\\mathbf{H}_c$ to angular velocity $\\boldsymbol{\\omega}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Frame of Reference**:\n",
    "The angular momentum equation $\\mathbf{H}_c = \\mathbf{I}_c \\boldsymbol{\\omega}$ is expressed in the **body frame**, which rotates with the rigid body. Here’s why:\n",
    "    - The components of $\\mathbf{I}_c$, the inertia tensor, are calculated in the body-fixed frame, as they depend on the mass distribution relative to the axes of the body.\n",
    "    - Similarly, $\\boldsymbol{\\omega}$, the angular velocity vector, is typically expressed in the body frame for rigid bodies because it simplifies computations (e.g., $\\boldsymbol{\\omega}$ is constant in the body frame).\n",
    "    - While the result is often interpreted in the body frame, the physical meaning of angular momentum is **frame-independent** since it is a property of the body itself. However, for practical calculations, it is most common to work in the body frame where the inertia tensor remains constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Why Not Inertial?**: In the inertial frame, $\\boldsymbol{\\omega}$ and $\\mathbf{I}_c$ would both vary due to the body's rotation. This makes the body frame more suitable for rigid-body dynamics, as it provides a fixed reference for mass distribution and simplifies the representation of angular momentum.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Conclusion**: The angular momentum equation about the center of mass, $\\mathbf{H}_c = \\mathbf{I}_c \\boldsymbol{\\omega}$, is most naturally expressed in the **body frame**, where the inertia tensor and angular velocity are consistent. However, angular momentum itself is a **frame-independent quantity**, meaning it can be transformed between frames if needed."
