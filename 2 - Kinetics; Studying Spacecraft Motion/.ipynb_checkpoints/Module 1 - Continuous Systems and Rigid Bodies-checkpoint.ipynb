    "# Week 1 - Continuous Systems and Rigid Bodies\n",
    "\n",
    "Week 1 introduces the fundamental principles behind the dynamics of continuous systems and their simplification into rigid bodies. The development of the equations of motion is rooted in classical Eulerian and Newtonian mechanics, focusing on angular momentum and rotational kinetic energy. The approach ensures the equations are derived in a coordinate frame-agnostic manner, making them broadly applicable across various reference frames.\n",
    "\n",
    "The week begins with an exploration of continuous systems, where deformable shapes are analyzed to capture the full complexity of their motion. These systems are then simplified into rigid bodies, a common approximation in spacecraft dynamics. This transition enables the formulation of simplified, yet powerful, equations of motion for systems with spinning components, such as reaction wheels or flywheels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding how to transition from continuous to rigid body systems is critical for spacecraft operations. These principles form the backbone of spacecraft dynamics, particularly when dealing with components that affect stability and control.\n",

    "A **principal axis** is a unique orientation of a rigid body where the products of inertia vanish. This means that in this orientation, the mass distribution is perfectly balanced about the off-diagonal axes, and the rotational motion about one axis is completely **decoupled** from the others. \n",
    "\n",
    "This happens because:\n",
    "1. In the initial inertial frame, the products of inertia (e.g., $I_{xy}, I_{xz}, I_{yz}$) quantify asymmetries in mass distribution that cause coupling between angular accelerations about different axes.\n",
    "2. If there exists a secondary orientation of the body (via rotation or realignment of the coordinate axes), the mass imbalance can be eliminated from the off-diagonal terms. This unique orientation defines the **principal axes** of the rigid body.\n",

    "To reflect this decoupling, it is often better to shift the notation from $x, y, z$ to $1, 2, 3$ when referring to the principal axes. This change emphasizes that the axes are no longer tied to a specific inertial frame but rather to the intrinsic geometry and mass distribution of the body.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Oscillatory Systems**:\n",
    "   - Systems like spring-mass oscillators, pendulums, or vibrating strings exhibit periodic energy exchange between KE and PE.\n",

    "\n",
    "<br>\n",

    "5. **Space Systems**:\n",
    "   - In spacecraft dynamics, energy conservation is critical. For example, during orbital motion, energy alternates between kinetic (due to velocity) and gravitational potential. \n",
