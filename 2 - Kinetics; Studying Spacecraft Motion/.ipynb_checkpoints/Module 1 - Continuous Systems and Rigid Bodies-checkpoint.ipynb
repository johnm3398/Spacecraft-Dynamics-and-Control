    "# Week 1 - Continuous Systems and Rigid Bodies\n",
    "\n",
    "Week 1 introduces the fundamental principles behind the dynamics of continuous systems and their simplification into rigid bodies. The development of the equations of motion is rooted in classical Eulerian and Newtonian mechanics, focusing on angular momentum and rotational kinetic energy. The approach ensures the equations are derived in a coordinate frame-agnostic manner, making them broadly applicable across various reference frames.\n",
    "\n",
    "The week begins with an exploration of continuous systems, where deformable shapes are analyzed to capture the full complexity of their motion. These systems are then simplified into rigid bodies, a common approximation in spacecraft dynamics. This transition enables the formulation of simplified, yet powerful, equations of motion for systems with spinning components, such as reaction wheels or flywheels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding how to transition from continuous to rigid body systems is critical for spacecraft operations. These principles form the backbone of spacecraft dynamics, particularly when dealing with components that affect stability and control.\n",

    "**Breaking it Down**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The angular momentum is computed as the cross product of $\\mathbf{\\sigma}$ and $\\mathbf{\\dot{p}}$, integrated over the entire system boundary $B$.\n",

    "   - $(\\mathbf{R}_c - \\mathbf{R}_P)$: vector from $P$ to the center of mass.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Conditions for Simplification**:\n",
    "   - If $P$ coincides with the center of mass ($\\mathbf{R}_P = \\mathbf{R}_c$), the additional term vanishes.\n",
    "   - Alternatively, if $P$ is inertial (i.e., not accelerating), $\\mathbf{\\ddot{R}}_P = 0$, and the additional term also vanishes.\n",

    "Thus, for common spacecraft applications:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbf{\\dot{H}}_P = \\mathbf{L}_P\n",
    "$$\n",
    "when moments are taken about the center of mass or an inertial reference point.\n",
    "\n",
    "<ins>**Key Takeaways**</ins>:\n",
    "- Angular momentum requires careful specification of the reference point $P$.\n",
    "- Moments taken about the center of mass or an inertial point simplify the governing equations.\n",
    "- This approach is particularly useful in spacecraft dynamics, where external torques and internal angular momentum must be analyzed about a meaningful pivot point.\n"
