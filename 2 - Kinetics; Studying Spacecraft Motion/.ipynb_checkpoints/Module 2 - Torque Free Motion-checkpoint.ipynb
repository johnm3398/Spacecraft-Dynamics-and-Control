    "Week 2 explores the dynamics of single and dual rigid body systems under torque-free conditions, a critical scenario in spacecraft dynamics when no external torques act on the system. The module examines large-scale tumbling motions through the use of **polhode plots**, which visualize the angular velocity motion in the body frame. Analytical rate solutions are derived for both axi-symmetric and general spacecraft shapes, providing insights into how shape and mass distribution affect motion.\n",

    "The module concludes with an analysis of the **dual-spinner dynamical system**, a practical example of how gyroscopic effects can be leveraged to stabilize a principal axis spin. This is particularly relevant for spacecraft with spinning components like reaction wheels or flywheels, where stability is key to maintaining attitude control.\n",
