    "# Week 3 - Gravity Gradients\n",
    "\n",
    "This week focuses on the influence of **gravity gradients** on the motion of rigid bodies in space. Gravity gradient effects arise due to the differential gravitational force across an extended body. By approximating these effects to the first order, the module examines how they perturb both the attitude and orbital motion of spacecraft. \n",
    "\n",
    "A key outcome of this week is the derivation of gravity gradient relative equilibria conditions. These equilibria are analyzed for stability through linearization techniques, providing insights into how spacecraft orientation naturally evolves in response to Earth's gravity field. \n",

    "Gravity gradient torque is a crucial factor in **Attitude Determination and Control Systems (ADCS)**, as it arises naturally due to the variation in gravitational force across an extended rigid body in orbit. The Earth's gravity exerts a **differential pull** on different parts of the satellite, causing the **lower** portions to experience slightly stronger attraction than the **upper** portions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tidal force results in a restoring torque that aligns the satellite’s **principal axis of inertia** with the local vertical. For satellites such as the **Techsat 21 constellation**, gravity gradient stabilization was originally considered due to its **passive nature**, reducing the need for active control actuators.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding this effect is critical in ADCS design because:\n",
    "- It can be leveraged for **passive attitude stabilization**.\n",
    "- It induces **unwanted torques** that may affect precision pointing.\n",
    "- It influences **long-term attitude drift** and spacecraft orientation.\n",
