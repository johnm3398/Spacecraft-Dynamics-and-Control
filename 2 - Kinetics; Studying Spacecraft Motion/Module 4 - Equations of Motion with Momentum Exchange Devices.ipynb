    "# Week 4 - Equations of Motion with Momentum Exchange Devices\n",
    "\n",
    "This module delves into the **equations of motion for rigid bodies** equipped with general momentum exchange devices. These devices play a pivotal role in attitude control systems for spacecraft. The development starts with the most general type—**variable speed control moment gyros (VSCMGs)**—and then progresses to specialized devices such as **single-gimbal control moment gyros (CMGs)** and **reaction wheels (RWs)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "By comparing these devices, we gain insights into how motor torques and gyroscopic dynamics generate control torques on the spacecraft, influencing its attitude. Understanding the dynamic interaction between these devices and the spacecraft body is essential for designing efficient and reliable attitude control systems.\n",

    "A VSCMG is essentially a classic CMG whose rotor spin rate is not fixed but is actively controlled.  \n",
    "- **Hybrid CMG/RW**: Because both the gimbal rate and the wheel speed can be modulated, a single device can act like a reaction wheel (by changing spin speed) or like a CMG (by changing gimbal angle).\n",

    "- **VSCMG fix**: By also varying the rotor speed, the effective $\\mathbf H_i$ vectors no longer remain coplanar at a singular gimbal angle, so the Jacobian retains full rank and you never hit an uncontrollable configuration.\n",

    "- If a wheel motor fails, you can still torque via gimbal motion (albeit with fixed $|\\mathbf H|$), or shift tasks to the remaining units.  \n",

    "This integrated approach reduces mass and complexity compared to separate batteries, reaction wheels, and CMGs.\n",

    "> *Key takeaway*: VSCMGs merge the best of reaction wheels and CMGs—adding spin-rate control removes gimbal singularities and gives built-in redundancy, while also enabling hybrid power storage.*"
