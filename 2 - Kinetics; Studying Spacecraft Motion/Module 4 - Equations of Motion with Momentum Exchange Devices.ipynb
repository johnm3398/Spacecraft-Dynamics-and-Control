    "# Week 4 - Equations of Motion with Momentum Exchange Devices\n",
    "\n",
    "This module delves into the **equations of motion for rigid bodies** equipped with general momentum exchange devices. These devices play a pivotal role in attitude control systems for spacecraft. The development starts with the most general type—**variable speed control moment gyros (VSCMGs)**—and then progresses to specialized devices such as **single-gimbal control moment gyros (CMGs)** and **reaction wheels (RWs)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "By comparing these devices, we gain insights into how motor torques and gyroscopic dynamics generate control torques on the spacecraft, influencing its attitude. Understanding the dynamic interaction between these devices and the spacecraft body is essential for designing efficient and reliable attitude control systems.\n",

    "**<ins>Primary Challenges</ins>**  \n",
    "1. **Momentum Saturation**: Wheel speeds grow under persistent external torques and must be desaturated\n",
    "2. **Zero‐Crossing & Stiction**: Bearings may stick near $\\omega\\!=\\!0$, causing torque ripple (modern wheels largely mitigate this)\n",
    "3. **Structural Imbalance & Vibration**: Even slight rotor imbalance induces jitter at spin frequency\n",
    "4. **Thermal & Mechanical Limits**: Continuous operation heats electronics; rotor containment needed in failure\n",
