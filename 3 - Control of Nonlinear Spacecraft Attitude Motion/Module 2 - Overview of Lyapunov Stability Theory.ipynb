    "For nonlinear dynamical systems, determining stability by explicitly solving the equations of motion is often impractical or impossible.  \n",
    "Even when solutions exist, they may be too complex to yield clear insight into long-term behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linearization provides only **local** information about stability near an equilibrium point and cannot, in general, guarantee nonlinear stability for large deviations. This limitation motivates the need for a method that reasons directly about the nonlinear system without requiring closed-form solutions or linear approximations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lyapunov’s direct method addresses this challenge by introducing a **scalar function of the system state**, denoted by $V(x)$, which acts as a generalized measure of energy or “distance” from equilibrium.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than tracking the system trajectory $x(t)$ explicitly, Lyapunov’s method examines how the value of $V(x)$ evolves along trajectories of the nonlinear system. If $V(x)$ behaves in a controlled manner—remaining bounded or decreasing over time—strong conclusions about stability and convergence can be drawn.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key insight of Lyapunov’s direct method is that **stability can be inferred from inequalities**, not from explicit solutions. By analyzing the sign and properties of $V(x)$ and its time derivative $\\dot{V}(x)$, one can establish stability properties of the equilibrium without integrating the equations of motion.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach forms the foundation of nonlinear stability analysis and enables both local and global stability arguments, depending on the properties of the chosen Lyapunov function."

    "Lyapunov’s direct method is based on the construction of a scalar function of the system state, denoted by $V(x)$, called a **Lyapunov candidate function**. This function is proposed as a tool for assessing the stability of an equilibrium point of a nonlinear system.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function $V(x)$ is defined on the state space and is evaluated relative to an equilibrium state, which is typically shifted to the origin without loss of generality. Its role is to provide a single scalar measure that reflects how “far” the system state is from equilibrium.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conceptually, a Lyapunov candidate function can be interpreted as a generalized energy measure. Just as physical energy is zero at equilibrium and increases as a system moves away from equilibrium, $V(x)$ is constructed to capture deviation from the equilibrium in a scalar form.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, the function $V(x)$ is **not required to correspond to physical energy**, nor is it uniquely defined. Multiple candidate functions may exist for the same system, and there is no universal recipe for selecting one. The function is proposed based on physical intuition, mathematical structure, or experience with similar systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this stage, $V(x)$ is referred to as a *candidate* because proposing a function alone does not guarantee stability. The ability of $V(x)$ to prove stability depends on specific mathematical properties of both $V(x)$ and its time derivative along system trajectories, which are examined next."
