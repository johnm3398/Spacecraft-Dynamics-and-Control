    "# Week 4 - Static Attitude Determination\n",
    "\n",
    "This week, we dive into the fascinating world of static attitude determination. Here, the focus is on taking a snapshot of multiple directional observations—like the sun’s heading, magnetic field direction, and star positioning—to compute a spacecraft's 3D orientation. Essentially, we’re using known vectors in both the spacecraft and reference frames to figure out “which way is up” in space.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll cover both classic and modern algorithms that are fundamental in the field of attitude determination. These include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **TRIAD Method**: A foundational, straightforward technique for calculating attitude based on two vector observations.\n",
    "- **Devenport’s q-Method**: A method that minimizes a cost function to estimate attitude, using quaternions as the rotation representation.\n",
    "- **QUEST (QUaternion ESTimator)**: An optimized version of the q-method, designed for real-time applications and quick computations.\n",
    "- **OLAE (Optimal Linear Attitude Estimation)**: A linearized approach that simplifies calculations, particularly useful in scenarios with multiple observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the module, we’ll not only dive into how these methods work, but also discuss the pros and cons of each, especially in terms of computational efficiency and accuracy.\n",

    "# 4.1) Attitude Determination Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Attitude determination involves finding the orientation of an object (such as a spacecraft) in space, using instantaneous measurements of specific reference directions. This topic focuses on determining attitude without relying on dynamic filtering or rate measurements (e.g., gyroscopes), which are covered in more advanced topics like Kalman filters and require estimation theory. Here, the aim is to determine the orientation based solely on direct observations.\n"

    "**<ins>Problem Outline</ins>**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Objective**: Determine the orientation (attitude) of a body using known reference directions. At a given instant, we take several measurements (e.g., sun, magnetic field, or star directions) to compute the 3D orientation.\n",
    "- **Challenge**: Measurements provide partial orientation information; to resolve full 3D attitude, multiple independent observations are needed. This leads to scenarios of being \"under-sensed\" (insufficient data for a complete attitude) or \"over-sensed\" (more data than necessary).\n",
    "  \n",
    "**<ins>Key Assumptions</ins>**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Fixed Position**: We assume knowledge of the object’s position within its environment. Without this, any directional observation (e.g., “the sun is to my right”) would lack context.\n",
    "2. **Known Environment**: The orientation computations require known reference frames, such as the Earth-Centered Inertial (ECI) frame for measurements like the sun or magnetic field directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**<ins>Measurement Requirements</ins>**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Minimum Requirements for 3D Attitude**: Attitude in 3D space has three degrees of freedom, requiring at least two independent direction vectors (each providing two pieces of information).\n",
    "- **Heading Information**: Each directional observation is a unit vector, meaning it only provides two independent pieces of data (e.g., azimuth and elevation), not three. Thus, one vector is insufficient, and two vectors are typically over-specified.\n",
    "\n",
    "**<ins>Example Scenarios</ins>**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **2D Orientation**: In 2D (like being rotated in a plane), knowing one direction (e.g., facing North) is enough if the object’s position is fixed.\n",
    "- **3D Orientation with Floating Object**: In a space station, knowing that a docking port is to your right doesn’t fully define orientation since you could still rotate around the axis pointing to the port.\n",
    "\n",
    "**<ins>Measurement Process</ins>**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Observations in Body Frame**: Measure known directions (e.g., sun or magnetic field) relative to the object’s body frame.\n",
    "2. **Environmental Reference in Inertial Frame**: Convert these observations to the inertial frame for comparison. For example, if the sun’s direction is known in ECI coordinates, compare the observed direction with the known direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**<ins>Error Sources</ins>**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Measurement Noise**: Sensor inaccuracies, quantization errors, and digital noise impact readings.\n",
    "2. **Environmental Uncertainties**: \n",
    "   - **Magnetic Field**: The Earth’s magnetic field varies and is not precisely predictable.\n",
    "   - **Sun Position**: Small uncertainties exist due to Earth’s orbit and satellite positioning errors.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   These uncertainties complicate the precise determination of the body’s orientation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**<ins>Mathematical Requirements</ins>**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Mapping Observations to Attitude**: To determine attitude, we compute the Direction Cosine Matrix (DCM) or other attitude representations (e.g., quaternions, CRPs) that best align the measured directions in the body frame with their expected orientations in the inertial frame.\n",
    "2. **Optimization Needs**: Due to noise and over-specification, we rarely achieve a perfect match. Methods like least squares optimization are used to minimize error and achieve the best-fit attitude solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**<ins>Conclusion</ins>**\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem of attitude determination requires accurately interpreting direction measurements in the body frame relative to known inertial directions. The objective is to compute an orientation that best aligns these vectors, balancing error when more measurements are available than necessary for a complete 3D orientation. Various methods and algorithms exist to address this, each suited to different configurations of measurements and specific mission requirements.\n"

    "The Vector Triad Method is a deterministic approach to estimate a spacecraft's attitude at a given instant using two vector observations. This method introduces an intermediate frame, or \"triad\" frame, to simplify the problem. By aligning a third frame with both the inertial frame (e.g., stars or magnetic field) and the body frame (sensor measurements), the method allows a straightforward matrix solution to attitude estimation. Here’s an overview of the method and its key steps."

    "**<ins>Steps in the Vector Triad Method</ins>**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define Two Frames**:\n",
    "   - **Inertial Frame**: Denoted as the $N$ frame, representing known directions in space, such as the position of the sun or Earth's magnetic field. These directions are assumed to be known because we generally know the satellite or spacecraft's position in its orbit relative to the Earth.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Body Frame**: Denoted as the $B$ frame, representing measurements in the body’s coordinate system, such as sensor readings of the sun and magnetic field. Both the sun sensor and the magnetometer (MTM) provide vectors known in both the body frame and the inertial frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Triad Frame**: An intermediate frame denoted as $T$, introduced to mitigate the effects of sensor noise. Determining the body frame attitude directly from noisy sensor data can lead to inaccuracies. Instead, the triad frame serves as a bridge between the inertial and body frames, stabilizing the attitude estimation process.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Align the Primary Axis**:\n",
    "   - Select the most accurate measurement (e.g., the sun heading) and align it with the first axis ($\\mathbf{t}_1$) of the triad frame. The sun sensor typically provides a more precise measurement than the magnetic field sensor due to the variability of the Earth's magnetic field.\n",
    "\n",
