    "# Week 4 - Static Attitude Determination\n",

    "This week, we dive into the fascinating world of static attitude determination. Here, the focus is on taking a snapshot of multiple directional observations—like the sun’s heading, magnetic field direction, and star positioning—to compute a spacecraft's 3D orientation. Essentially, we’re using known vectors in both the spacecraft and reference frames to figure out “which way is up” in space.\n",

    "We’ll cover both classic and modern algorithms that are fundamental in the field of attitude determination. These include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **TRIAD Method**: A foundational, straightforward technique for calculating attitude based on two vector observations.\n",
    "- **Devenport’s q-Method**: A method that minimizes a cost function to estimate attitude, using quaternions as the rotation representation.\n",
    "- **QUEST (QUaternion ESTimator)**: An optimized version of the q-method, designed for real-time applications and quick computations.\n",
    "- **OLAE (Optimal Linear Attitude Estimation)**: A linearized approach that simplifies calculations, particularly useful in scenarios with multiple observations.\n",

    "Attitude determination involves finding the orientation of an object (such as a spacecraft) in space, using instantaneous measurements of specific reference directions. This topic focuses on determining attitude without relying on dynamic filtering or rate measurements (e.g., gyroscopes), which are covered in more advanced topics like Kalman filters and require estimation theory. Here, the aim is to determine the orientation based solely on direct observations.\n"

    "**<ins>Steps in the Vector Triad Method</ins>**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define Two Frames**:\n",
    "   - **Inertial Frame**: Denoted as the $N$ frame, representing known directions in space, such as the position of the sun or Earth's magnetic field. These directions are assumed to be known because we generally know the satellite or spacecraft's position in its orbit relative to the Earth.\n",

    "   - **Body Frame**: Denoted as the $B$ frame, representing measurements in the body’s coordinate system, such as sensor readings of the sun and magnetic field. Both the sun sensor and the magnetometer (MTM) provide vectors known in both the body frame and the inertial frame.\n",
    "\n",
