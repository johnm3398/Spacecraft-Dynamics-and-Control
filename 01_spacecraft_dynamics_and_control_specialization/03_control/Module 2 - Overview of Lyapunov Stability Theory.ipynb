    "# Week 2 - Overview of Lyapunov Stability Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "**<ins>Motivation</ins>**\n",
    "\n",
    "In nonlinear spacecraft dynamics, the equations of motion are rarely solvable in closed form.  \n",
    "Linearization can provide local insight, but it does not guarantee behavior for large-angle maneuvers or tumbling motion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lyapunov’s Direct Method provides a systematic way to study stability **without solving the differential equations explicitly**.  \n",
    "Instead of computing trajectories, we construct a scalar function that behaves like an energy measure and analyze how it evolves over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "If this function decreases appropriately, we can prove stability and, in stronger cases, convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method forms the foundation for modern nonlinear spacecraft attitude control design.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**<ins>Core Ideas</ins>**\n",
    "\n",
    "1) **Function Definiteness**\n",
    "\n",
    "The starting point is understanding positive definite, negative definite, and semi-definite functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "A positive definite function behaves like stored energy:\n",
    "- It is zero at the equilibrium.\n",
    "- It is strictly positive elsewhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the time derivative of this function is negative definite, the system dissipates “energy,” which implies convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "These definiteness properties are the mathematical backbone of Lyapunov analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2) **Lyapunov Candidate Functions**\n",
    "\n",
    "For mechanical and spacecraft systems, convenient prototype functions are available:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Rate-based functions**  \n",
    "  Built from angular velocity error (kinetic energy–like).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **State-based functions**  \n",
    "  Built from attitude error (potential energy–like).\n",
    "\n",
    "These prototype structures will later lead directly to nonlinear attitude control laws.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**<ins>Key Takeaways</ins>**\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this week, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Apply Lyapunov’s direct method to argue stability and convergence for nonlinear dynamical systems.\n",
    "2. Clearly distinguish between stability, asymptotic stability, exponential stability, and global versus local stability.\n",
    "3. Understand how Lyapunov theory connects directly to spacecraft attitude control design.\n",
    "\n",
    "This week builds the theoretical stability framework that the remainder of nonlinear spacecraft control relies on.\n",

    "Suppose you are given a nonlinear dynamical system\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\dot{x} = f(x)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and you want to know whether the system will remain near an equilibrium point or eventually return to it after being disturbed.\n",
    "\n",
    "One approach would be to solve the differential equation and inspect the solution $x(t)$. For nonlinear systems, this is usually unrealistic. Closed-form solutions rarely exist, and numerical simulations do not provide general guarantees.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lyapunov’s Direct Method takes a completely different approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of trying to solve for the motion, we ask a simpler question:\n",
    "\n",
    "Can we measure how “far” the system is from equilibrium using a single scalar quantity?\n",
    "\n",
    "We introduce a scalar function $V(x)$ that depends only on the current state. You can think of $V(x)$ as a generalized energy or a measure of distance from the equilibrium.\n",
    "\n",
    "If this scalar function satisfies two intuitive properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $V(x)$ is positive whenever we are away from equilibrium.\n",
    "2. $V(x)$ decreases as the system evolves.\n",
    "\n",
    "then the system behaves like a ball rolling in a bowl. The energy keeps decreasing, so the motion cannot escape or grow unbounded. The system is forced toward lower and lower values of $V(x)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The powerful idea here is that we do not need the exact trajectory $x(t)$.  \n",
    "We only need to understand how this single scalar quantity changes along trajectories.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we can show that\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\dot{V}(x) \\le 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "for all admissible states, then the system cannot increase its “energy.” Stability conclusions follow from this inequality alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why Lyapunov’s method is so effective for nonlinear systems. It converts a complicated vector differential equation into a problem about the sign of a scalar function and its time derivative.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stability is inferred from inequalities, not from explicit solutions."

    "Lyapunov’s direct method relies entirely on the **sign behavior** of a scalar function and its time derivative.  \n",
    "Before stability can be discussed, we need a precise way to describe whether a function consistently stays positive, negative, or changes sign near an equilibrium.\n",

If these expressions are positive definite and their time derivatives satisfy the required sign conditions, they become valid Lyapunov functions.\n",

    "However, resemblance to an energy expression is not sufficient. A function that “looks like energy” does not automatically prove stability. The critical requirement is that its time derivative along system trajectories, $\\dot{V}(x)$, satisfies the appropriate inequality. This must be established analytically from the system dynamics, not merely observed through simulation.\n",
